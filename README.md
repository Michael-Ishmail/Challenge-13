Welcome to my e-commerce backend project.

For this project, i attempted to run the npm seed command, but each time i received an error from mysql. The error was error 1045, and it had the following message;

MySQL ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'bill'@'localhost' (using password: YES)

I researched the issue and attempted to fix it, but i was unable to. I reinstalled mysql, created users on the local host with permissions, and manually reconfigured files on my system to attemt to grant access. Each of these fixes did not work for me on my machine. I did a little more digging, and i found that it might be an issue with the ARM M1 Macbook models, which i have. I was unable to complete the project due to this issue, and i have submitted what i was able to complete.
